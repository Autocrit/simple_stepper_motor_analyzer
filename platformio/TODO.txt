* Consider switching to 16 bits colors.

* Consider switchting to dual buffer DMA screen update.

* Switch to Pico SDK 1.2.x

* Switch to LVGL 8.

* In the oscilloscope and phase charts, make the major division lines thicker. (Requires LVGL 8).


============= DONE

* In the home page, call the coils A, B, not 1, 2.

* Consider to set WR_HL in the first gpio color table. //Didn't work. Insufficient hold time.

* Increase tft driver render loop inline to 20 pixels (currently 8)

* Increase chart horizontal resolution (and update rate). Display resoluion is 400 pixels.

* Consider to double the update rate of the steps and retraction charts to have
a more smooth graph animation.

* COnvert the java table generator to python

* When reentering the steps or retraction charts, clear them.

* Double the resolution of the capture buffer.

* Can we reduce the delays in the screen dump code?

* Consider to slightly increase the LVGL heap, just in case, since we have sufficient RAM.  // currently 32k, seems ok.
