* Delete junk kicad and model files.




----- Done

* Verify drill size of Molex pins

* Add a way to configure current range. E.g. via resistor.

* Increase horizontal clerance for the four screws. (extend the PCB).

* Reduce diameter of vias in ground pads of the pico

* Update instruction silk messages on the PCB (e.g. tape thickness)

* Verify sufficient clearance at the sides of the TFT, for buttons and LEDs.

* Make the LED footprint compatible with 0603 and 0805 LEDs.

* Clearer mark for pin 1 of the current sensors. E.g. a dot.

* Change the order of FPC 6 pins, to match the flat cable

* Add F-Silk marks with the stepper connector pin lables (A1, A2, ...)

* Move the Molex connector to be at 50 mill relative pitch

* Finalize BOM.

* Finalize the choice of connectors

* Smaller holes for the MOLEX connectors?

* MOSFET footprint too small?

* Smaller holes for the ground pads of the Pico?

* Move the BOOTSEL pad closer to the Pico's switch.

* Remove SWD pads from the PCB

* Diode footprint too small ?

* Lower profile switches

* Move the Molex connectors slightly out?

* Move LED 1,2 test points to the front of the board.

* Add duplicate leds on the front of the board.

* Review through holes

* Add a silkscreen text below the Pico to place Kapton tape here.

* Is the pullup resistor of the BOOT switch required?  

* Add mechanical dimensions.

* Add duplicate BOOT, RESET button on the front side (?)

* Add silkscreen marking for TFT position.

* Change the Pico pin silkscreen labels to reflect the function of the pin in the analyzer design.
